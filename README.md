# stockanalysis

My program must first read the data from the symbol.txt and date. txt data files and store the data in 1-D arrays. The maximum size of the array to store stocks symbols is 100. The maximum size of the array to store dates is 30. Using the values of m and n, the data from stock. txt is read and stored in the 2-D array, stocks.
My program must then provide a menu with the following options:
1. Find the highest closing price of a given stock and the date on which it occurred
2. Find the total volume traded of a given stock
3. Find the date of the biggest difference between high and low prices of a given stock
4. Find the stock with the biggest difference between high and low prices on a given date
5. Find the biggest changing stock price between a previous day's close and next day's open
6. Find the percentage increase/decrease of each stock based on first day / last day prices
7. Plot a graph showing the price of a given stock on each day
8. Quit
